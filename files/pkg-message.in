The following has been set up:

* %%PREFIX%%

* A basic configuration has been set up under %%PREFIX%%/control.

* Mail to root, postmaster and mailer-daemon will be delivered to %%PREFIX%%/alias/Maildir/.

* Service directories under %%PREFIX%%/svc have been created in the 'down' state and
  symlinked into the daemontools service directory.

* At service start up, per-service log directories will be created under /var/log.

* Files under %%PREFIX%%/ssl have been copied from the feh-ucspi-ssl etc directory, and
  %%PREFIX%%/ssl/ssl.env has been created.

* /usr/local/etc/man.d has been updated to include a reference to /var/qmail/man.


The following needs to be done by you:

* Verify the configuration under %%PREFIX%%/control.

* Disable any currently running mailers, like sendmail.

* Start qmail services by removing the service's 'down' file and running svc -u.


Optional:

* You can optionally update /etc/mail/mailer.conf to reference qmail programs.
  An example replacement file is in %%PREFIX%%/example.

* Install your own certificates in %%PREFIX%%/ssl.


What is left after deinstall:

* Deinstall will not remove any modified files under %%PREFIX%%/control.

* Deinstall will not remove any modified files under %%PREFIX%%/ssl.

* Deinstall will not remove anything under %%PREFIX%%/alias.

* Deinstall will not remove anything under %%PREFIX%%/svc.

* Deinstall will not remove log directories from /var/log.


General documentation can be found under %%PREFIX%%/doc.
